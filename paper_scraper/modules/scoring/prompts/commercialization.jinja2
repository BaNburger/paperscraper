## Example Responses

Example 1 - High Commercialization Potential (Score: 8.0):
```json
{
    "score": 8.0,
    "confidence": 0.82,
    "reasoning": "This diagnostic platform has multiple viable paths to market. Licensing to major IVD companies offers quick revenue with minimal capital. Alternatively, a spinoff could capture higher value given the platform's extensibility to multiple disease areas. Low regulatory barriers (CLIA waiver eligible) and strong industry interest de-risk commercialization.",

}
```

Example 2 - Low Commercialization Potential (Score: 3.5):
```json
{
    "score": 3.5,
    "confidence": 0.75,
    "reasoning": "While the technology shows promise, commercialization faces significant headwinds. The semiconductor manufacturing equipment market is dominated by a few large players with entrenched customer relationships. The capital requirements for market entry are prohibitive, and the technology's advantages over existing solutions are incremental rather than transformative.",
    "recommended_path": "licensing",
    "alternative_paths": ["acquisition"],

        "regulatory": "medium",
        "capital": "high",
