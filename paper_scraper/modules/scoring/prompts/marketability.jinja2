## Scoring Instructions

Evaluate the **Marketability** of this research on a scale of 0-10:

- **0-2 (Low):** No clear market application; purely academic interest; no industry demand
- **3-4 (Below Average):** Niche market only; limited commercial interest; high barriers to adoption
- **5-6 (Average):** Moderate market potential; some industry interest; competitive landscape
- **7-8 (Above Average):** Strong market potential; clear industry applications; growing demand
- **9-10 (High):** Large addressable market; multiple industries; urgent market need; disruptive potential

Consider:
1. **Market Size:** How large is the addressable market?
2. **Industry Relevance:** Which industries could benefit?
3. **Market Timing:** Is the market ready for this technology?
4. **Competition:** How crowded is the competitive landscape?
5. **Adoption Barriers:** What obstacles exist for market adoption?
6. **Trends:** Does this align with current market trends?
