## Scoring Instructions

Evaluate the **Novelty** of this research on a scale of 0-10:

- **0-2 (Low):** Incremental improvement on well-established methods; no significant new insights
- **3-4 (Below Average):** Minor variations on existing work; limited new contributions
- **5-6 (Average):** Some new elements but builds heavily on prior work; moderate innovation
- **7-8 (Above Average):** Clear novel contributions; new methodology or significant improvements
- **9-10 (High):** Groundbreaking research; paradigm-shifting discoveries; first-of-its-kind

Consider:
1. How different is this from existing state-of-the-art?
2. Does it introduce new concepts, methods, or applications?
3. Is it a first-in-class discovery or incremental improvement?
4. How does it compare to the similar papers provided?

## Example Responses

Example 1 - High Novelty (Score: 8.5):
```json
{
    "score": 8.5,
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "This paper introduces a fundamentally novel approach to protein folding prediction using quantum-inspired algorithms. Unlike existing deep learning methods that rely on sequence similarity, this approach directly models quantum mechanical interactions, enabling predictions for proteins with no known homologs.",
    "key_factors": ["first quantum-inspired approach in this domain", "breaks dependency on sequence databases", "enables novel protein predictions"],
    "comparison_to_sota": "While AlphaFold and similar methods achieve high accuracy on known protein families, they struggle with orphan proteins. This method addresses that gap with a completely new paradigm."
}
```

Example 2 - Low Novelty (Score: 3.0):
```json
{
    "score": 3.0,
    "confidence": 0.90,
    "reasoning": "This paper applies an existing transformer architecture to a new dataset in medical imaging. While the results are solid, the methodology closely follows previous work, with the main contribution being the collection and annotation of a new dataset rather than algorithmic innovation.",
    "key_factors": ["standard methodology applied to new dataset", "no architectural innovations", "incremental improvement over baselines"],
    "comparison_to_sota": "The approach mirrors several recent papers in the field, differing primarily in the specific medical condition studied rather than the underlying technology."
}
```
