Given the following research group description and keywords, evaluate these candidate researchers
and explain why they would be a good fit based on their expertise and publication history.

Group: {{ group_name }}
{% if group_description %}Description: {{ group_description }}{% endif %}
Keywords: {{ keywords | join(', ') }}

Candidate researchers (ranked by embedding similarity):
{% for author in candidates %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ author.name }}
   Affiliations: {{ author.affiliations | join(', ') if author.affiliations else 'Unknown' }}
   H-Index: {{ author.h_index or 'N/A' }}
   Citation Count: {{ author.citation_count or 'N/A' }}
   Works Count: {{ author.works_count or 'N/A' }}
{% endfor %}

For each candidate, provide:
1. A relevance score (0-100) based on how well they match the group focus
2. A brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of why they would be a good fit
3. Key matching areas of expertise

Respond with a JSON object:
{
  "candidates": [
    {
      "name": "Researcher Name",
      "relevance_score": 85,
      "explanation": "Brief explanation of fit...",
      "matching_keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
    }
  ]
