## Scoring Instructions

Evaluate the **Feasibility** of commercializing this research on a scale of 0-10:

- **0-2 (Low):** Theoretical concept only; TRL 1-2; decades from practical application
- **3-4 (Below Average):** Early research stage; TRL 3-4; significant technical challenges remain
- **5-6 (Average):** Proof of concept demonstrated; TRL 5-6; needs substantial development
- **7-8 (Above Average):** Technology validated; TRL 7-8; clear path to product
- **9-10 (High):** Near production-ready; TRL 9; minimal technical risk

Consider Technology Readiness Level (TRL):
- TRL 1-2: Basic principles observed/formulated
- TRL 3-4: Proof of concept/lab validation
- TRL 5-6: Technology validated in relevant environment
- TRL 7-8: System prototype demonstration
- TRL 9: Actual system proven

Also evaluate:
1. **Technical Complexity:** How complex is implementation?
2. **Resource Requirements:** What resources are needed (capital, expertise, infrastructure)?
3. **Time to Market:** Estimated development timeline
4. **Technical Risks:** What could go wrong technically?
5. **Scalability:** Can this scale from lab to production?
6. **Dependencies:** What external technologies/resources are required?

## Example Responses

Example 1 - High Feasibility (Score: 7.5):
```json
{
    "score": 7.5,
    "confidence": 0.80,
    "reasoning": "The paper demonstrates a working prototype of the biosensor with clinical validation data from 200+ patients. Manufacturing uses standard semiconductor processes, and the team has already identified a contract manufacturer. Main remaining work is regulatory clearance.",
    "estimated_trl": 7,
    "time_to_market_years": "1-2",
    "development_cost_estimate": "medium",
    "key_technical_risks": ["Regulatory approval timeline", "Sensitivity in real-world conditions"],
    "required_capabilities": ["FDA regulatory expertise", "Clinical trial management"],
    "scalability_assessment": "easy"
}
```

Example 2 - Low Feasibility (Score: 2.5):
```json
{
    "score": 2.5,
    "confidence": 0.70,
    "reasoning": "This theoretical framework for room-temperature superconductivity presents intriguing physics but lacks experimental validation. The proposed materials have not been synthesized, and the conditions described present significant engineering challenges that may take decades to overcome.",
    "estimated_trl": 2,
    "time_to_market_years": "10+",
    "development_cost_estimate": "very_high",
    "key_technical_risks": ["Material synthesis feasibility", "Fundamental physics assumptions untested"],
    "required_capabilities": ["Advanced materials synthesis", "High-pressure physics expertise", "Substantial research funding"],
    "scalability_assessment": "uncertain"
}
