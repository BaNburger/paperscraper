## Scoring Instructions

Evaluate the **Feasibility** of commercializing this research on a scale of 0-10:

- **0-2 (Low):** Theoretical concept only; TRL 1-2; decades from practical application
- **3-4 (Below Average):** Early research stage; TRL 3-4; significant technical challenges remain
- **5-6 (Average):** Proof of concept demonstrated; TRL 5-6; needs substantial development
- **7-8 (Above Average):** Technology validated; TRL 7-8; clear path to product
- **9-10 (High):** Near production-ready; TRL 9; minimal technical risk

Consider Technology Readiness Level (TRL):
- TRL 1-2: Basic principles observed/formulated
- TRL 3-4: Proof of concept/lab validation
- TRL 5-6: Technology validated in relevant environment
- TRL 7-8: System prototype demonstration
- TRL 9: Actual system proven

Also evaluate:
1. **Technical Complexity:** How complex is implementation?
2. **Resource Requirements:** What resources are needed (capital, expertise, infrastructure)?
3. **Time to Market:** Estimated development timeline
4. **Technical Risks:** What could go wrong technically?
5. **Scalability:** Can this scale from lab to production?
6. **Dependencies:** What external technologies/resources are required?
