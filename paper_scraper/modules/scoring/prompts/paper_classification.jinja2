## Classification Instructions

Classify this paper into ONE of the following categories:

1. **ORIGINAL_RESEARCH** - Primary research presenting new experimental results, clinical trials, empirical studies, or novel data analysis
2. **REVIEW** - Comprehensive literature reviews, systematic reviews, scoping reviews, or meta-analyses summarizing existing research
3. **CASE_STUDY** - Individual case reports, case series, or detailed examination of specific instances
4. **METHODOLOGY** - Papers primarily focused on introducing new methods, protocols, tools, or techniques
5. **THEORETICAL** - Papers presenting new theoretical frameworks, mathematical models, or conceptual analyses without empirical data
6. **COMMENTARY** - Editorials, opinions, perspectives, letters to editors, or brief commentaries on other work
7. **PREPRINT** - Early-stage research, working papers, or preliminary findings (typically identified by source)
8. **OTHER** - Conference abstracts, datasets, software papers, or papers that don't fit other categories

## Decision Criteria

- Look at the paper structure implied by the abstract (methods, results, discussion)
- Consider whether it presents NEW data vs synthesizing existing literature
- Check if it's a single case vs generalizable research
- Evaluate if the focus is on methodology development
