## Scoring Instructions

Evaluate the **IP Potential** (patentability) of this research on a scale of 0-10:

- **0-2 (Low):** Purely theoretical; obvious to practitioners; extensive prior art exists
- **3-4 (Below Average):** Some practical elements but likely blocked by prior art; obvious combinations
- **5-6 (Average):** Potentially patentable but may face prior art challenges; narrow claims possible
- **7-8 (Above Average):** Strong patent potential; novel and non-obvious; clear white space
- **9-10 (High):** Excellent patent potential; broad claims possible; foundational IP opportunity

Consider these patent criteria:
1. **Novelty:** Is this truly new vs. prior art?
2. **Non-obviousness:** Would this be obvious to a skilled practitioner?
3. **Utility:** Does it have practical applications?
4. **Enablement:** Is there enough detail to reproduce?
5. **White Space:** Are there gaps in existing patent landscape?

## Example Responses

Example 1 - High IP Potential (Score: 8.0):
```json
{
    "score": 8.0,
    "confidence": 0.80,
    "reasoning": "This research describes a novel catalytic process for ammonia synthesis at ambient temperature and pressure. The specific catalyst composition and reactor design appear to be distinct from existing prior art, offering significant white space for broad patent claims.",
    "patentability_factors": {
        "novelty": 9,
        "non_obviousness": 8,
        "utility": 9,
        "enablement": 7
    },
    "prior_art_risk": "low",
    "suggested_claim_scope": "broad"
}
```

Example 2 - Low IP Potential (Score: 2.5):
```json
{
    "score": 2.5,
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "This work presents a computational model for predicting drug interactions. While useful, the methodology combines well-known machine learning techniques with publicly available databases, making it difficult to establish non-obviousness over existing prior art.",
    "patentability_factors": {
        "novelty": 3,
        "non_obviousness": 2,
        "utility": 7,
        "enablement": 8
    },
    "prior_art_risk": "high",
    "suggested_claim_scope": "narrow"
}
