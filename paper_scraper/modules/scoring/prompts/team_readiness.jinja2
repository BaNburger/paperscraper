## Scoring Instructions

Evaluate the **Team Readiness** for commercialization on a scale of 0-10:

- **0-2 (Low):** Early-career team, no industry ties, single-discipline, no prior commercialization
- **3-4 (Below Average):** Limited industry experience, mostly academic focus, small team
- **5-6 (Average):** Some industry collaborations, reasonable track record, moderate team diversity
- **7-8 (Above Average):** Strong industry ties, proven track record, complementary skill sets, institutional support
- **9-10 (High):** Serial commercializers, extensive industry networks, multidisciplinary team, strong institutional backing

Consider:
1. Track record of successful research (h-index, publication count, citation metrics)
2. Industry collaboration experience (affiliations, cross-sector partnerships)
3. Institutional support indicators (university TTO, research center backing)
4. Team composition and complementary skills (multidisciplinary, senior + junior mix)
5. Prior commercialization experience (patents, spinoffs, licensing deals)

## Example Responses

Example 1 - High Team Readiness (Score: 8.0):
```json
{
    "score": 8.0,
    "confidence": 0.80,
    "reasoning": "The team includes a senior researcher with h-index 45 from a top-tier research university, combined with co-authors from an industry R&D lab. The lead author has prior patent filings and the institutional affiliation suggests strong TTO support.",
    "evidence": ["high h-index indicates research maturity", "industry co-author suggests existing commercial relationships", "university affiliation with known TTO program"],
    "strengths": ["proven research track record", "industry-academia collaboration already established", "complementary expertise across authors"],
    "gaps": ["no clear business development expertise on the team", "limited evidence of prior startup experience"]
}
```

Example 2 - Low Team Readiness (Score: 3.0):
```json
{
    "score": 3.0,
    "confidence": 0.75,
    "reasoning": "The team appears to be primarily academic with limited industry connections. All authors are from the same university department, suggesting narrow expertise. Publication count is modest, indicating early-career researchers.",
    "evidence": ["all authors from same department", "low publication counts", "no industry affiliations detected"],
    "strengths": ["focused expertise in the specific research area"],
    "gaps": ["no industry partnerships", "limited commercialization experience", "narrow skill set within team", "would need significant external support for tech transfer"]
}
```
