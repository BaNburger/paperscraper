## Why This Change?

This document was moved as part of the documentation restructuring to:
- Create a modular, navigable documentation structure
- Reduce context window consumption for AI coding agents
- Follow single-source-of-truth principles
- Improve discoverability through [docs/INDEX.md](docs/INDEX.md)

**Please use the new location:** [docs/architecture/DECISIONS.md](docs/architecture/DECISIONS.md)
